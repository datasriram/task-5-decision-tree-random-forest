Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification on Heart Disease dataset using Python. Includes tree visualization, overfitting control, feature importance, and model comparison.
# Task 5 – Decision Tree & Random Forest Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** algorithms to classify patients based on heart disease risk using the Heart Disease Dataset. It includes tree visualization, overfitting control, feature importance, and model performance comparison.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle – Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
- **File:** `heart.csv`
- **Target Column:** `target`  
  - `1` → Heart disease present  
  - `0` → No heart disease

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Data loading & exploration
2. Decision Tree training with controlled depth
3. Visualization of Decision Tree
4. Random Forest training and comparison
5. Feature importance analysis
6. Evaluation with classification report, confusion matrix, and cross-validation
